I have used the famous iris dataset to demostrate multi-class classification using k nearest neighbors and multinomial logistic regression.
The dataset can be easily imported from sklearn datasets.It is divided into data and target.The target has 3 flower classes coded as 0,1,2.
The task is to classify the samples based on various features,petal length,petal width,sepal length,sepal width.

This is a pretty claean and simple data.
